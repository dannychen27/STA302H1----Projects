Data Cleaning

Q1: What's with the NA country entries? Maybe this could be under the "undetermined" country.
A1: Some students may have left this entry blank on the survey. Perhaps either students forgot to answer the question about country of origin, or they were embarrassed to include their country of origin.

Q2: Can I simply ignore the missing COVID hours entries, STA302H1 study times, and missing quiz marks -- since students can opt not to write certain quizzes or complete the weekly surveys?
A2: Yes. That's totally fine.

Q3: What do I do with rows that contain one or more NAs?
A3: If a row only has 1 or 2 NAs, that's ok. However, if there are 3 - 4 NAs that may indicate a student who has dropped STA302H1.
You should exclude dropped students from your final dataset.

Q4: What is imputation?
A4: Imputation is when you replace missing values with substituted default values.


Scatterplot

Q5: I created a large pairwise scatterplot using the pairs() function. It contains 144 boxes, but 12 of them are the main diagonal and 66 of them (the bottom half of the scatterplots) are redundant since they are reflections about the line y = x of the upper half of the scatterplots.
How do I know which scatterplots are most important to focus on?
A5: The large pairwise scatterplot provides an overview of all possible scatterplots and their relationships -- more visual and informative as a first step than the correlation matrix which is more detail and numerical.
You may want to ignore the main diagonal and the bottom half of the scatterplots.

After that, here are some ideas:

1. Break up the giant pairs plots into 2 - 4 smaller pair plots using pairs()?

- Quiz 4 scores as a function of Quiz 1 - 3 scores,
- Week 4 COVID hours as a function of Weeks 1 - 3 COVID hours,
- Week 4 STA302H1 hours as a function of Weeks 1 - 3 STA302H1 hours.

2. Pick out 4 - 5 distinct scatterplots that exhibit an interesting relationship.

3. Back up your scatterplots with the correlation matrix of your chosen pairs of predictor variables.

Correlation Matrix

Q5: What's the difference between pairwise complete observations and (strictly) complete observations in a correlation matrix?
A5: A pairwise complete observation is less picky (preserves more of the dataset) than a strictly complete observation.


Model Selection

Q6: Are
A6:


Q7: Rank the following methods:

	50/50 (training/testing) split, 80/20 split, k-fold cross validation, obtaining independent dataset.


from best to worst.
A7: 1. obtaining independent dataset
- expensive, infeasible, sometimes new samplings of population are inaccessible

2. K-fold cross validation
- like doing multiple 80/20 splits on smaller datasets
- less prone to overfitting because unlikely to overfit by accident

3. 80/20 split
- harder to overfit than 50/50
- can still accidently overfit

4. 50/50 split
- smaller training dataset makes it easier to overfit, this reflects in validation model


Final Report Contents

Q8: Why does R code belong in the appendix instead of the report body?
A8: The report body visualization must resemble ones you'd see in the New York Times or some other professional publication.

Q9: Does the pairwise correlation plot count as a visualization?
A9: Although it's more visual than a correlation matrix, it's still not quite a visualization: they belong in the Appendix section (add "see appendix for details")
Instead, you should report on the pairs of predictor variables with high correlations, analyze them more closely, and consider
recentering your data or transforming your variables to make them more normally distributed and more amenable to CLT/hypothesis testing/CIs, etc.
You might write something like:

	"Preliminary data analysis shows these two predictor variables are significant ... so we did .... and 
	explored these variables more closely."

Q10: What should exploratory data analysis contain?
A10: Descriptive statistics is one thing.

Q11: What about the Model Development section?
A11: Describe what model you want to use, and back it up using theory from class (gauss-markov, 4 properties of simple linear regressions, etc.)
And empirical observations like residual plots, prior knowledge, etc.

Q12: How do I produce cleanly formatted tables?
A12: See Demo 3 or 4 for an example.
