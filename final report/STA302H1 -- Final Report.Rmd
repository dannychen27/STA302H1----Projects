# Introduction

The purpose of this report is to study the relationship between a student's country of origin, the time they spent studying for STA302H1 (weeks 1 - 4), the time they spent thinking about COVID-19 (weeks 1 - 4), and their interim STA302H1 quiz scores (quizzes 1 - 3) versus final STA302H1 quiz scores (quiz 4).

Existing studies in pedagogy tend to focus on individual factors that affect course performance, such as the number of hours slept, or the number of hours spent studying for a course. However, my paper intends to explore multiple covariates simultaneously to assess their collective effect on final quiz grades, as well as the effects of two covariates on each other.

## Information about Our Popoulation

Our population of interest is a group of students from the online summer 2021 (July - August) STA302H1S cohort, which originally had 227 students at the start of the term, but has 198 students enrolled as of August 13, 2021.

## Experiment Description

The professor announced at the beginning of the term and in the syllabus that she would survey students on Quercus, and collect information about their quiz scores at the end of each week for the first 4 weeks of STA302H1. Each week is specified by a date range below:

- End of Week 1 (July 5 – July 9)
- End of Week 2 (July 12 – July 16)
- End of Week 3 (July 19 – July 23)
- End of Week 4 (July 26 – July 30)

After 4 weeks, students received Quercus access to the anonymous STA302H1 performance dataset to develop a model for analysis during the STA302H1 final project.

## Purpose of Developing A Model

The purpose of developing a model is to determine what the strongest predictors for Quiz 4 grades are: interim STA302H1 quiz scores, study time, COVID contemplation time, country, or some combination of these factors.

Developing this model primarily benefits professors and students. Current professors can identify possible weak topics by identifying topics that yield the lowest quiz scores, reflect on things they did/did not help students, and then devote resources to improving lectures or creating carefully curated tutorials that address topics that students find challenging. Teaching stream professors and future STA302H1 professors would inherit these resources so they can establish reasonable STA302H1 learning goals, thoroughly prepare for more formative lectures, and address common student conceptual pitfalls that undermine student quiz scores.

When current STA302H1 students can quickly understand which factors really contribute to a high final STA302H1 grade, they have more cognitive resources available to focus on key material to getting high grades on hard quizzes and adapt to the pace of STA302H1, and they have time to implement their current study strategies or improve flawed ones in time for final assessments. Moreover, future students can establish reasonable expectations about workload and develop strategies to maximize their time and success in STA302H1 with available resources.

## Plan for Developing Model

The dataset contained a small number of typos, so I opted to clean my data manually rather than programmatically. This included removing the word "hours" to safely cast numeric parts of strings as integers, removing non-Unicode characters like "UTF-098”, and capitalizing "canada" and "china", so that they would be treated the same as the countries "Canada" and "China." To finish off the data cleaning process, I decided to group similar columns (i.e., COVID times, study times, and quiz scores) together.

Although some entries in the dataset contained missing (NA) data, I treated missing quiz grades as more problematic than rows with only missing number of COVID hours, number of STA302H1 study hours, or even missing countries of origin. Students may forget to, or abstain from sharing countries of origin, the number of COVID hours, or number of STA302H1 study hours -- yet continue to write STA302H1 quizzes. To preserve as much of the original dataset as possible, I decide to categorize NA countries as unknown, and leave NA COVID hours and STA302H1 hours alone. Students may occasionally miss 1 - 2 quizzes by accident due to incompatible timezones with Toronto, or because they have recently exited the STA302H1 waitlist. The best "3 out of 5" quiz marking scheme is designed to accommodate these students. However, students who miss 3 or more quizzes usually drop STA302H1 because they may fall too far behind in STA302H1 lectures to catch up in time for quizzes, or are otherwise not in a good position to commit to completing STA302H1, unless they are experiencing extenuating circumstances that warrant a petition for additional missed quizzes.
With the accelerated pace of summer STA302H1, it is much easier to fall behind and much harder to catch up if one does not commit to spending enough time with STA302H1.

First, I'll exclude dropped students from my final dataset since are unlikely to contribute available quiz 4 scores. I plan to identify any influential outliers to remove, as no amount of variable transformations or variable re-centering can effectively correct them. \newline
(TODO: Add influential outlier checks later on.) \newline
(TODO: Also remove students without Quiz 4 scores?)

Then I will create descriptive statistics such as histograms, boxplots, 5-number summaries, and pairs scatterplots to reveal useful relationships that will help me determine a reasonably informed, yet simple model. 
(TODO: Address variable transformations to reduce skewness if necessary.) \newline
(TODO: Address variable re-centering to reduce multicollinearity if necessary)

I will use model diagnostics to verify assumptions of my final model. Lastly, I will also consult empirical research and scholarly research to  confirm my findings and propose ways to improve my model.

# Explanatory Data Analysis

There are a total of 13 variables in the dataset. The response variable is a student's quiz 4 score, and the predictor variables are the remaining 12 variables: a student's country of origin, the time they spent thinking about COVID-19 during weeks 1 - 4, the time they spent studying for STA302H1 during weeks 1 - 4, and their Quiz 1 - 3 scores.
